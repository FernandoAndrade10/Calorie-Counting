# Calorie Counting

Find the total sum of calories of each elf.

## Description

This project is my answer to the puzzle at Advent of Code Day 1. https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1

The jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; 
the Elves' expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. 
One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).

The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.

In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories.

Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?
